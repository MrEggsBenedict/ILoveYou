I’ve spent so many moments thinking about how to express this, and I’ve realized that sometimes words can feel too simple for something this deep. 
But I can’t keep it to myself any longer—what I feel is too real, too certain to hide away.

I love you. It’s not about grand gestures or perfect moments, but about the quiet comfort of knowing you’re out there, and how my life feels richer with you in it. The way I smile when I think of you, how the world seems a little lighter when you’re near, even when we’re just being ourselves in the same space.

There’s a peace in loving you that I didn’t know I was searching for. And no matter where this path leads, I’m just so grateful to have you in my life. That’s all. Just wanted you to know.
